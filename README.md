# TreeList
Implemented a list by using an augmented binary tree data structure:
- An independent module in C++ that can insert, delete and print elements in just O (log n) worst-case
time, where n is the current size of the list.
- This is a significant improvement over classic ways to implement a list (arrays and linked list) which
need O(n) time for some of these operations.
- A vector like interface, with an iterator has been given to the List.
- The module follows object-oriented structure and has been thoroughly tested on a variety of test cases.
